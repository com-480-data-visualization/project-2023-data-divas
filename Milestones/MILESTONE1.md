## Milestone 1 (23rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This first milestone is dedicated to the explanation and assesment of the feasability of our project. Let us guide you through our ideas...

## Dataset

The first dataset, available at [Our World In Data - GHG emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions#licence), presents global carbon dioxide (CO2) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 1750 to 2021. The data are sourced from a variety of international organizations, including the International Energy Agency (IEA), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the Global Carbon Project.

The second dataset, available at [Our World In Data - GHG by sector](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector#annual-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-sector), presents global GHG emissions by sector from 1960 to 2016. The data are sourced from the same international organizations as the first dataset, and are broken down by sector, including industry, transport, agriculture, and electricity.

Both datasets are of high quality, with data sourced from reputable international organizations and presented in a clear and accessible manner. The data are also regularly updated, ensuring that users have access to the latest information.

The topic of these datasets, GHG emissions and their impact on the environment, is of significant relevance in today's world, as climate change continues to be a major global challenge. The datasets provide valuable information for policymakers, researchers, and the public, helping to inform decisions on climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.

However, the datasets are complex and may require some technical expertise to fully understand and analyze, the EDA sections will go deeper in this sense. Additionally, while the datasets cover global emissions, there may be limitations in terms of data availability for specific countries or regions.

Overall, the datasets provide a comprehensive and valuable resource for understanding global GHG emissions and their impact on the environment, and are a valuable tool for informing climate change policy and decision-making.

## Problematic

One could undertand from the description of the datasets that the main topic of our visualization project is the worldwide repartition of GHG emissions.

The emission of these gases is a widely discussed topic in the media, as it has significant implications for the environment and human society. However, despite its importance, the topic can be complex and difficult to understand, which can make it difficult for the general public to engage with the issue and take action to reduce emissions.

To help address this challenge, our visualization will be based on an interactive map that to explain the distribution of emissions around the globe in a way that is easy to understand. This map will display the data in an engaging and striking way so that it has impact to the reader.

By making this information more accessible and engaging, the interactive map aims at raising awareness of the importance of reducing GHG emissions and the need for collective action to address climate change. This would help foster a greater sense of urgency and commitment among individuals to take action to reduce emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy.

In order to complete above purposes, we decide to visualize on a map which contains the CO2 emission  on each country by year. For every country, we also produce an access to the comparison of CO2 emission by different sectors. Therefore, we could have a better understanding about the source of CO2 emission, like which country have a high CO2 emission in a specific year, and which is the main factor causing such results. Besides, the evolution of global CO2 emission could also be acquired so that we could have a broad overview of the overall worldwide tendency.

From the [Emissions by sector]([url](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector#sector-by-sector-where-do-global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-come-from)), we could obtain the CO2 emission evolution by sector by the selected country, which help us have a great understanding about the CO2 emission trend in the country that audiences have interests.

> - Why is your approach original?

Compared to the research above, we produce a broader view about the CO2 emission around the world not just focusing on an interested country, therefore, the audience could compare the CO2 emission between countries. Besides, they could explore the CO2 emission information on the countries that they have not noticed before. What's more, we hope to make our visualization as interactive as possible so that audiences have higher flexibility to explore the information they want.

Our source of inspiration is from [worldpoverty]([url](https://worldpoverty.io/map)) website, which produces a interactive world map with high flexibility. Our goal is trying to visualize the information in a convienient, concise and polished way.
