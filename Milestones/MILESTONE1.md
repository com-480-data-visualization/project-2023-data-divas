## Milestone 1 (23rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This first milestone is dedicated to the explanation and assesment of the feasability of our project. Let uzs guide you through our ideas...

## Dataset

The first dataset, available at [Our World In Data - GHG emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions#licence), presents global carbon dioxide (CO2) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 1750 to 2021. The data are sourced from a variety of international organizations, including the International Energy Agency (IEA), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the Global Carbon Project.

The second dataset, available at [Our World In Data - GHG by sector](https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector#annual-greenhouse-gas-emissions-by-sector), presents global GHG emissions by sector from 1960 to 2016. The data are sourced from the same international organizations as the first dataset, and are broken down by sector, including energy, industry, transport, agriculture, and forestry. The data are presented in various formats, including tables, graphs, and interactive visualizations.

Both datasets are of high quality, with data sourced from reputable international organizations and presented in a clear and accessible manner. The data are also regularly updated, ensuring that users have access to the latest information.

The topic of these datasets, GHG emissions and their impact on the environment, is of significant relevance in today's world, as climate change continues to be a major global challenge. The datasets provide valuable information for policymakers, researchers, and the public, helping to inform decisions on climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.

However, the datasets are complex and may require some technical expertise to fully understand and analyze, The EDA sections will go deeper in this sense. Additionally, while the datasets cover global emissions, there may be limitations in terms of data availability for specific countries or regions.

Overall, the datasets provide a comprehensive and valuable resource for understanding global GHG emissions and their impact on the environment, and are a valuable tool for informing climate change policy and decision-making.

## Problematic

One could undertand from the description of the datasets that the main topic of our visualization project is the worldwide repartition of GHG emissions.

The emission of these gases is a widely discussed topic in the media, as it has significant implications for the environment and human society. However, despite its importance, the topic can be complex and difficult to understand, which can make it difficult for the general public to engage with the issue and take action to reduce emissions.

To help address this challenge, our visualization will be based on an interactive map that to explains the distribution of emissions around the globe in a way that is easy to understand. This map will display the data in an engaging and striking way so that it has impact to the reader.

By making this information more accessible and engaging, the interactive map aims at raising awareness of the importance of reducing GHG emissions and the need for collective action to address climate change. This would help foster a greater sense of urgency and commitment among individuals to take action to reduce emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

## Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
